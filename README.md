**When it comes to music, you want to keep up with the tempo.** Where's the band from? Where are they touring? What's their discography?

Tempo is a centralized database for bands, but not just the well-known or celebrity bands. You can upload your own band's information and be part of the Tempo database. Once you've entered your band's information, you can come back and edit or update the information. Easy as that! Get your band's name out there and be seen!

## About
TEMPO helps users keep up with band information. It displays information for all bands in the database and allows new bands to add their information for other users to see. 

This app uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure to organize our file set up, and Express Handlebars to create our html templates and display our database information. Sequel is used to store band data.
